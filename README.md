# Whitelist

**The** whitelist to install on AGH, your seperate devices, or at your grandparents house. 

AdBlockers are awesome, and adding additional filters is even more awesome. What isn't awesome is having to deal with false positives, then having to manually whitelist domains.
This whitelist attempts to stop the need of that.

This list could be finding a new home located on the domain https://shubam.tech, I may also host it on a subdomain under https://g.shubam.tech/whitelist/list.txt or I also plan on making a https://whitelist.shubam.tech which will make the list easier to reach, and more visually appealing.

I am 99.9% sure this list will always stay in this repo, but will also have a secondary link to it. 

### Will this catch all false positives?

No. That's not possible.

Some services require domains that serve ads (ad.doubleclick.net) or tracking domains to be whitelisted. My goal is to not add those to the whitelist, that way anyone who uses the whitelist won't expierence ads and trackers.


# Installation

All applications are different. **This list is NOT compatible with PiHole, and using it will cause more false positives.** This list **is 100% compatible** with uBlock Origin and all AdGuard products AdGuard Home, AdGuard Windows / Mac, AdGuard iOS / Android, etc.
